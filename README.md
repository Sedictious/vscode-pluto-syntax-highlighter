# PLUTO Syntax Highlighter

This simple extension provides highlighting for PLUTO (Procedure Language for Users in Test and Operations),
as defined in [ECSS-E-ST-70-31C](https://ecss.nl/standard/ecss-e-st-70-31c-ground-systems-and-operations-monitoring-and-control-data-definition/).

The highlighter follows the basic naming conventions so it should be compatible with most VS Themes
